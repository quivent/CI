# CIR - Collaborative Intelligence in Rust

CIR is a modern CLI tool for working with the Collaborative Intelligence system, providing a structured interface for agent management, project integration, source control operations, and system management tasks.

## Instant Command Creation

When you type `CIR:[command-name]`, I will:

1. Extract the command name (everything after `CIR:`)
2. Ask you: "What does '[command-name]' do?"
3. Auto-categorize the command based on keywords in your description
4. Generate all necessary code including proper helpers and structure
5. Update required files (commands/mod.rs, main.rs)
6. Provide you with the implementation and instructions to build

### Example Usage

```
User: CIR:backup
AI: What does 'backup' do?
User: Create project backups
AI: [Generates code, updates files]
Done! Build with: cargo build
```

### Auto-Categorization Logic

I'll automatically categorize your command based on keywords:
- Words like "git", "commit", "branch", "merge" → Source Control
- Words like "config", "setup", "settings" → Project Lifecycle
- Words like "agent", "load", "memory" → Intelligence & Discovery
- Words like "install", "build", "system" → System Management

## Instant Agent Loading

When you type `AGENT:[agent-name]`, I will:

1. Extract the agent name (everything after `AGENT:`)
2. Automatically execute the equivalent of `cir load [agent-name]`
3. Show the agent's capabilities and memory
4. No prompting or confirmation required

## Project Behavior

1. Begin implementation of tasks immediately after creating todo items
2. Prioritize completing tasks in the order they are specified unless otherwise instructed
3. Make intelligent decisions about task implementation without excessive consultation
4. Automatically test code changes when possible before marking tasks as complete
5. Proactively request necessary information if required to complete a task

## Code Style

1. Follow existing code style conventions in the project
2. Maintain consistent formatting with the rest of the codebase
3. Add appropriate error handling for all code modifications
4. Include only necessary comments - focus on clear, self-documenting code
5. Use the helper infrastructure for common operations

## Command Implementation Guidelines

1. All commands should use the helper modules for common operations
2. Follow the existing category structure:
   - Intelligence & Discovery (Blue)
   - Source Control (Green)
   - Project Lifecycle (Yellow)
   - System Management (Cyan)
3. Use consistent error handling and user messaging
4. Include proper documentation and examples
5. Follow Rust best practices and idioms

## Testing Requirements

1. All new commands should have corresponding tests
2. Use the testing framework in `tests/` directory
3. Test both success and failure scenarios
4. Use mock repositories and environments where appropriate
5. Ensure tests can run in CI environments

## System Integration

CIR is designed to work with the Collaborative Intelligence system while maintaining its own streamlined architecture:

1. Can work independently or integrated with CI
2. Supports agent loading and management
3. Provides project lifecycle management
4. Facilitates source control operations
5. Handles system configuration
